Iâ€™m an 18-year-old student who was in love with technology ever since I got my hands on an I-pod touch 9 years ago (4th Generation). After that, I have always wanted to be a part of the technology community. When I was 14 I got my first laptop, this was when I discovered that you can make your own programs and code them, so they can do simple commands for you. My first program was a revised version of Jarvis. Jarvis was a batch file that you can edit to become your personal assistant.  From there I started to learn a couple of programming languages and made some cool programs. Several years later I find myself in college doing what I love.
